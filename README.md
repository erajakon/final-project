## Data
The reason that I chose the project that I did is because my family, who are Tamil, fled Sri Lanka in the midst of the Civil War and subsequent genocide. The government, which has an extensive history of discrimination and persecution against the Tamil people on the island, intentionally obfuscates information and provides false narratives and corresponding data. The conflict itself is complex and hard to understand even if you are familiar with the dynamics of Sri Lanka, so finding a way to build understanding of the conflict by providing context and illustrating the severity of the situation is what I aim to do via my data visualizations. The failure to create the understanding and awareness needed to build support necessary towards tangible international action has been an issue for those advocating for marginalized communities of Sri Lanka and that’s what I hope to help contribute to with this project.

Due to the role of the government in regards to withholding data and providing false data, I was intentional about the sources that I utilized to help identify my data sets. These sources included the United Nations, the Council on Foreign Affairs, the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, the Worldwatch Institute, ACLED, Peace Insight, International Crisis Group, Minority Rights Groups International, and Amnesty International. In addition, I also took a look at the information released by advocacy groups such as PEARL, the Sri Lanka Campaign for Truth and Justice, the Adayaalam Centre for Policy Research, and the International Truth and Justice Report. Most of these resources and most of the resources that I found did not have extensive easy to use data lists that I would just be able to download in plug in. The data that I found was typically by working through the reports and going through the works and data they had cited to come to their conclusions. In particular, the 2015 United Nations report provided a significant amount of data. With this in mind, working through this project I will have to be deliberate about how I pull data from the report and the sources that they used and how I plan on organizing it. How I plan to do that in conjecture with creating the visualizations is something I a process that I’m still working out, though most likely I will use my ideas for visualization and the data that I have available to concurrently influence each other as I work through the organizational phase of this project.

## Method and Medium

As stated before, the need to build understanding of the situation of Sri Lanka is the purpose of this project. As it is a complex history and we are looking to build a story that we will be telling with data, my method here will to use a loose and easy to follow-timeline broken into major eras. The timeline will be build using a combination of historic context and visualizations of data that illustrate the situation.  This timeline started to come together as I built out my initial sketches of the project. I aim to use data to help illustrate three narratives that tie into a larger cohesive narrative of a history of discrimination and persecution of marginalized communities in Sri Lanka. The first era will be between Independence and the War, where I will help lay out a narrative of the discriminatory policies by the Sri Lankan Government that helped lead to increasing tensions. The second narrative will be to discuss the War itself and the atrocities committed during it, in particular during the final stages of the war in 2009. The third narrative will be of a hard peace and continued struggles of marginalized communities on the island. Together, this will be tied together into a larger narrative of a history of discrimination and persecution of marginalized communities in Sri Lanka. At the end of the project, there will be a call to action with ways to advocate for or otherwise contribute to efforts for Sri Lanka’s marginalized communities, with the hope that the increased understanding of the severity of the situation will help spur the audience member to action.

The medium that I plan on using is Shorthand. From the examples that were provided through this class and through the website, as well, it seems appropriate for the narrative that I’m looking to tell. It provides an easy to scroll through and a method that if utilized appropriately can be very visually appealing. In particular, I think it is particular conducive to the adjusted timeline organization that I plan on using or this project, which is the most important reason for me opting for this medium.

## User Research Protocol 

a.	Target Audience

The target audience that I wanted to target with my story was the general public. In the wake of the Easter Sunday Bombings, there was a lot of discussion of Sri Lanka, but not a lot of understanding of its complex history. As a result, lost in the narrative in the general conscience was the understanding of the arduous plight of minority communities in that country over decades. It is important to put out the narrative of the realities of Sri Lanka, as the government, for decades, has been involved in cover-ups and spinning a narrative to the international community in an attempt to evade accountability. Without increasing awareness of Sri Lanka, an understanding which requires an understanding of the nation’s complex history, international action is highly unlikely – without which minority communities will remain under threat. My goal with this project is to condense over 70 year of a very complicated history into an understandable and informative piece of information for the general reader.

b.	My Approach To Identifying Representative Individuals To Target:

To identify representative individuals to target, I considered individuals that I knew who would read the type of informational material that I was about to prepare but weren’t too well-versed on Sri Lanka. These were individuals that I regularly discussed the news with and who I knew consistently read informative publications, but who I had not had many discussions around Sri Lanka with. I also found individuals who weren’t particularly avid readers or news junkies, because my target audience is the general public, and while those who follow the news more closely are more likely to read the type of material I was producing, I wanted it to be informative to the average person . Ahead of asking them questions about how I was structuring my presentation, I asked them a few questions to gauge their familiarity with the topic. 

c.	My Interview Script: 

  1.	Screening Questions on Sri Lanka Knowledge
  2.	Walk Through of My Outline With Narrative and Basic Figures
  3.	Walk Through of My Storyboard
  4.	Questions – Major Questions (Which Depending On Answers I Tailored Follow-Up Questions For More Information):
    
    a.	Can you briefly summarize what you learned?
    b.	What were your major takeaways?
    c.	What aspects did you find confusing?
    d.	Would you recommending keeping the JVP section in the presentation?
    e.	Are there any structural improvements you would recommend?
    f.	Any general feedback or constructive criticism?
    g.	Does this provide a compelling case for my call to action?
    
d.	The Findings from my Interviews: 

The interviews provided some useful insight in terms of what my audience was looking for. I had a tendency to get bogged down on the details, as it is a complex situation over a long period of time. However, speaking to my audience they reminded me that I needed to provide a more general overview and focus on critical facts and information, in particular numbers, that would help bolster my case and illustrate the severity of the situation. I also was considering including discussion on the violent crackdown against the JVP communist uprisings against the government in the 1970s and 1980s, which helped add context to the Sri Lankan’ government’s approach of killing with impunity. However, feedback from the audience confirmed some of my fears of this being a confusing subplot in the greater narrative, which should focus more on the ethnic strife to form a more cohesive narrative for the general public.

e.	Changes Implemented To Story Board: 

The interviews I conducted were highly useful in informing the development of my final story boards. For one thing, the emphasis that each interviewee placed on the need to provide context regarding the groups being addressed in Sri Lanka made me reassess the structure and how it flowed. In particular, it made me reassess how I broke the history into eras, and what critical flashpoints I should use to help anchor and drive the story. It led to a simplified and less convoluted story board than I had initially created, as it made me focus on the story because beforehand I was getting bogged down in the details when designing the structure.

# Write-Up

For my final data story, the intended audience was the general public. In the wake of the Easter Sunday Bombings, there was a lot of false narratives that were taking root about Sri Lanka, and the government has evaded accountability for decades with false and misleading narratives that are pervasive in the international community. I wanted to create a data story that would help illustrate the severity of the discrimination and persecution wrought upon marginalized communities in the nation. To refine the data story, I had to come to the understanding that it would be a more informed segment of the general public that would find use from the data story that I was created, and even then that I would have to be considerate of the fact that Sri Lanka is a small nation and that there is not a great general knowledge base about the island that I could rely on to help build the basis of the story.
  
As a result, to make the story work for my audience, I had to help build the base of their understanding by building context about the parties involved and weaving that into a cohesive and chronological narrative. Using interviews conducted with a sample of people I knew who were representative of the audience that I was trying to reach. The key thing that I learned from those interviews and used to narrow the focus was not to get bogged down in the details. As a result, I took the approach of providing a general overview, with a few critical points to help anchor and drive the story forward, and added detail to help flesh out that narrative.
  
In addition to the work that I had to do around crafting the narrative, I had to do a significant amount of work in order to identify and create visualizations for the data that was relevant to my story. The difficulty of tracking persecution across decades is at certain times it is harder to find data than others. In particular, during the war, the government worked to actively obfuscate the toll of the war on Tamil Civilians. It took a tremendous amount of reading and work to extract the data I needed from a variety of publications and reports from organizations that were credible, primarily the United Nations, that would help accurately and effectively support the story that I was telling.
  
In addition to structure and the crafting of data visualizations, I also had to take into consideration how I would be able to really portray the human cost of the strife in Sri Lanka. I wanted to utilize pictures and videos that would help lend context to the narrative and add power to the human aspect of storytelling. It’s one thing to see the numbers and the data especially considering the astounding numbers from the data that I utilized in this project, but it is the human aspect that really connects with audiences. When the numbers are shown through a human reality – whether it be the conditions of a “hospital”, the last minutes of the victim of a violent pogrom, or the pain of a mother who still does not know the fate of her child – that’s what makes the data and narrative I speak about in this project not only resonate with an audience at an emotional level, but hopefully speak to our moral obligations as people and as an international community, thus hopefully compelling action.
