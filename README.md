## Outline
Sri Lanka: A History of Discrimination and Persecution

High Level Summary: The project aims to use data to help illustrate the plight of minority communities, particularly that of the Tamil population, in Sri Lanka over the last 71 years. By using data to help illustrate the severity of these struggles, the aim is to issue a call to action at the end which will resonate with the reader.

## Data
The reason that I chose the project that I did is because my family, who are Tamil, fled Sri Lanka in the midst of the Civil War and subsequent genocide. The government, which has an extensive history of discrimination and persecution against the Tamil people on the island, intentionally obfuscates information and provides false narratives and corresponding data. The conflict itself is complex and hard to understand even if you are familiar with the dynamics of Sri Lanka, so finding a way to build understanding of the conflict by providing context and illustrating the severity of the situation is what I aim to do via my data visualizations. The failure to create the understanding and awareness needed to build support necessary towards tangible international action has been an issue for those advocating for marginalized communities of Sri Lanka and that’s what I hope to help contribute to with this project.

Due to the role of the government in regards to withholding data and providing false data, I was intentional about the sources that I utilized to help identify my data sets. These sources included the United Nations, the Council on Foreign Affairs, the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, the Worldwatch Institute, ACLED, Peace Insight, International Crisis Group, Minority Rights Groups International, and Amnesty International. In addition, I also took a look at the information released by advocacy groups such as PEARL, the Sri Lanka Campaign for Truth and Justice, the Adayaalam Centre for Policy Research, and the International Truth and Justice Report. Most of these resources and most of the resources that I found did not have extensive easy to use data lists that I would just be able to download in plug in. The data that I found was typically by working through the reports and going through the works and data they had cited to come to their conclusions. In particular, the 2015 United Nations report provided a significant amount of data. With this in mind, working through this project I will have to be deliberate about how I pull data from the report and the sources that they used and how I plan on organizing it. How I plan to do that in conjecture with creating the visualizations is something I a process that I’m still working out, though most likely I will use my ideas for visualization and the data that I have available to concurrently influence each other as I work through the organizational phase of this project.

## Method and Medium

As stated before, the need to build understanding of the situation of Sri Lanka is the purpose of this project. As it is a complex history and we are looking to build a story that we will be telling with data, my method here will to use a loose and easy to follow-timeline broken into major eras. The timeline will be build using a combination of historic context and visualizations of data that illustrate the situation.  This timeline started to come together as I built out my initial sketches of the project. I aim to use data to help illustrate three narratives that tie into a larger cohesive narrative of a history of discrimination and persecution of marginalized communities in Sri Lanka. The first era will be between Independence and the War, where I will help lay out a narrative of the discriminatory policies by the Sri Lankan Government that helped lead to increasing tensions. The second narrative will be to discuss the War itself and the atrocities committed during it, in particular during the final stages of the war in 2009. The third narrative will be of a hard peace and continued struggles of marginalized communities on the island. Together, this will be tied together into a larger narrative of a history of discrimination and persecution of marginalized communities in Sri Lanka. At the end of the project, there will be a call to action with ways to advocate for or otherwise contribute to efforts for Sri Lanka’s marginalized communities, with the hope that the increased understanding of the severity of the situation will help spur the audience member to action.

The medium that I plan on using is Shorthand. From the examples that were provided through this class and through the website, as well, it seems appropriate for the narrative that I’m looking to tell. It provides an easy to scroll through and a method that if utilized appropriately can be very visually appealing. In particular, I think it is particular conducive to the adjusted timeline organization that I plan on using or this project, which is the most important reason for me opting for this medium.
